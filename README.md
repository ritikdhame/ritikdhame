  As a passionate hiker, I know the thrill of reaching the summit and gaining a clear perspective of the terrain and landscape around me. Similarly, my love for data analysis and data science stems from the power it holds in providing a clearer picture of complex datasets, unlocking valuable insights that can drive success for organizations across various industries.

  My competency in data processing, building efficient data pipelines, visualization and handling data quality tools such as SQL, Spark, Tableau, and Power BI, Excel, DBT coupled with my experience in programming languages such as R, Python and machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, PySpark have allowed me to provide comprehensive solutions to organizations. My skills in cloud platforms and other tools like AWS, Snowflake, GitHub, Azure, Docker have enabled me to give organizations a complete understanding of their data, building data pipelines, conducting A/B testing, performing time series analysis, forecasting and conducting hypothesis testing to leverage it for their success.

  But my passion for exploration and analysis is never satisfied, and I am constantly seeking new ways to develop my skills and knowledge in this field. I am excited to apply my passion and expertise to a dynamic organization where I can continue to learn and grow while making valuable contributions to the team.
